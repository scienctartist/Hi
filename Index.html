     <h1>hi everyone</h1>
       <p><h2>A valuable skill in life is to be larger than the situation.</h2></p>When you're feeling stressed or rattled, the situation is consuming you. It feels bigger and more important than it needs to be. This is when your emotions are likely to get the best of you.<br>
         But when you are larger than the situation, you can mentally <b>"step outside and above it."</b> 
          <p>Yes, there are problems to be solved. Yes, you need to take action. But the chaos is happening externally and you are still in the driver's seat internally. <i>You're in control of the moment, the moment is not in control of you.</i></p>
            <hr>You shouldn’t sell advice for things you haven’t done.
